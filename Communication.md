# Overview
Communication is key to successful delivery of a project. It is important to continuously ask questions, make comments or offer insight as soon as there is an update or question that prevents progress. There will be 4 key methods of communication:

1. [Asana](#1-asana)
2. [Slack](#2-slack)
3. [Skype](#3-skype)
4. [Email](#4-email)


### 1. Asana
Asana should be used for updating projects and tasks. Files should be added to the relevant task. Comments/Questions/Notes should be added to the relevant task and anyone who is relevant should be added as a follower so that they are alerted and will be notified. Ideally **all** questions should be place in Asana so that there is a proper history of the conversation in one place.

### 2. Slack
Slack will be used for day to day communication. Asana and Github will be connected to Slack to allow for notifications to appear in the Slack feed. 

The UK team members will attempt be online during the following hours: Monday - Friday 9AM - 5PM GMT. 

Set the status to `away` when not currently available for chat.

Use `@username` commands to send direct messages to users when sending messages that do not affect other team members.

### 3. Skype
Skype will be used for voice/video communication. There should be at minimum 1 Skype call a week to update the progress of the project.

Ensure that `donnie.sixberries` is added on Skype.

### 4. Email
Email will be used for all other communication. Things that are not specifically project related should be sent via email.
